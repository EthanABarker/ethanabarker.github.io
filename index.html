								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>Hello there! My name is Ethan Barker and I am currently studying BSc(Hons)Computer Games Programming<br />
								at Staffordshire University. I started programming at the age of 10 beginning with small text based games in Python. On this website you can find some of the projects I've worked on for both personal and academic purposes.</p>

								<h2>Games Engine Creation</h2>
								<p>In Games Engine Creation, I was tasked with creating a platformer like Mario in C++ using the SDL library. In this module I practiced my C++ skills with tasks like handling collisions, loading maps and making multiple playable characters using polymorphism.</p>

								<h2>In Another Castle</h2>
								<p>While studying at College I was tasked with creating a platformer game in Unreal Engine 4. The result was the In Another Castle game I created. This cyberpunk inspired platformer demo was one of my first forte into level design as well as the UE4 Blueprint System.</p>

								<h2>F.O.G.S</h2>
								<p>In my first semester at university I made a short project using C++ along with Staffordshire University's in house library S2D. In this project I made a playable character who could cycle through a large animation sheet depending on player input.</p>

								<h2>Skills</h2>
								<p>Over my years of studying I have developed skills in many different areas related to game development. In this section of my portfolio I'll list some of the skills I find to be the most relevent. </p>

							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon solid fa-gamepad">
									<h3>Unreal Engine</h3>
									<p>Over the two years I spent studying at Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies I had to use Unreal Engine 4 for a multitude of projects. I have made many different short games using Unreal Engine including Tower Defence Games, Platformer Games and Role Playing Games. </p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-file-code">
									<h3>C++</h3>
									<p>During my time at Staffordshire University I have been working a lot in C++. I have developed basic 2D games using the both S2D Library and SLD library as well as Graphics programming using OpenGL.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3>C#</h3>
									<p>I learned C# while learning to use the Unity games engine. Since then I have made many different genres of games using this programming language, however it is far from my strongest language.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon brands fa-unity">
									<h3>Unity Engine</h3>
									<p>While I prefer working in the Unreal Engine to Unity I have worked in them both. While at Staffordshire University I have had to use the Unity Engine for a multitude of projects.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon brands fa-python">
									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>Python was the first programing language I ever learnt and although I rarely use it nowadays since I am more focused on languages such as C++, I still am quite proficient with the language.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon brands fa-html5">
									<h3>HTML5</h3>
									<p>While studying at Staffordshire University I had to learn HTML5 to be able to make a Portfolio website.</p>
